A seminar for beginners who are interested in learning [React](https://react.dev).

Check out my website in [Netlify](https://malloc-todo.netlify.app/)!

## Getting Started

Use [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) for Node.js version management.

```bash
fnm use
```

Use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as a package manager.

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

Run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```
